<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

* I need to create a React single page app with a Product View, Shopping Cart View, and Product Detail View
* The data will be taken from Kroger's website
* It is possible to satisfy the condition with the given instructions

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

* I have used methods when creating a todo list and news app that can be applied to this project

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>

* Each Step can be seen clearly and can be proven to be correct

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>

* The arguments and results can be checked
* This functionality can be applied to any ecommerce site.
* Solution for how the products and in-cart products are stored can be done better. They are currently stored in a js array of objects. A better solution would be to store the information in a json file.
